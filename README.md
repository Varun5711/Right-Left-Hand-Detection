# Hand Detection using Mediapipe  

This project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect hands from a webcam feed and classify them as **Left Hand**, **Right Hand**, or **Both Hands**.  

## 📁 Project Structure  

hand-detection/
│── main.py
│── README.md
│── requirements.txt

## ⚡ Features  

- Detects **left hand**, **right hand**, or **both hands**.  
- Uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking.  
- Displays real-time results using **OpenCV**.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Install dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies:
	•	opencv-python
	•	mediapipe
	•	protobuf

🚀 How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-detection.git
cd hand-detection


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the script:

python main.py


	4.	Press ‘q’ to exit the program.

📌 How It Works
	1.	Captures video from the webcam.
	2.	Converts frames to RGB (required by MediaPipe).
	3.	Detects hands using MediaPipe’s Hands module.
	4.	Classifies detected hand(s) as Left, Right, or Both Hands.
	5.	Displays results using OpenCV.

🎯 Future Enhancements
	•	Add gesture recognition.
	•	Optimize detection speed.
	•	Implement hand-tracking for specific applications.
